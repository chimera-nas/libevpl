# coverage-report.sh - Merge clang source-based coverage data and print a report
#
# Usage: coverage-report.sh BUILD_DIR
#
# Expects the test suite to have already run with the binaries instrumented by a
# Coverage build (-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping) and with
# LLVM_PROFILE_FILE pointing into BUILD_DIR/coverage/profraw (see the Makefile's
# test_coverage target). This merges every *.profraw into a single profdata file
# and prints a per-file llvm-cov report covering the libevpl source tree.
#
# Set COVERAGE_HTML=1 to additionally emit a browsable HTML report under
# BUILD_DIR/coverage/html. COVERAGE_JSON=<path> exports per-file summaries;
# COVERAGE_LCOV=<path> exports line hits for paths listed (one per line) in
# COVERAGE_LCOV_SOURCES. An empty source list skips the LCOV export.
