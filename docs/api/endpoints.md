# Endpoints

Provides functions for creating and managing network address/port combinations used for binding and connecting.


## Types

### `struct evpl_endpoint`

Opaque structure representing a network endpoint (IP address or DNS hostname + port number).  evpl_endpoints need to be resolved to an address to be used.

### `struct evpl_address`

Opaque structure representing a resolved network address (IP + port).  Generated by resolving an evpl_endpoint, or to represent the peer on received connections and datagrams.

## Functions

### `evpl_endpoint_create`

```c
struct evpl_endpoint *evpl_endpoint_create(
    const char *address,
    int         port);
```

Create an endpoint from an IP address string and port number.

**Parameters:**
- `address` - IP address as string (IPv4 or IPv6), or `NULL`/`"0.0.0.0"` for wildcard
- `port` - Port number (1-65535)

**Returns:** Endpoint handle, or `NULL` on failure

**Address formats:**
- IPv4: `"192.168.1.100"`, `"10.0.0.1"`
- IPv6: `"::1"`, `"fe80::1"`, `"2001:db8::1"`
- Wildcard: `NULL`, `"0.0.0.0"`, `"::"` (any address)
- Hostnames: `"example.com"`, `"localhost"` (resolved via DNS)

---

### `evpl_endpoint_close`

```c
void evpl_endpoint_close(struct evpl_endpoint *endpoint);
```

Destroy an endpoint and free its resources.   Optional.  If not called, endpoints are freed at process exit.

**Parameters:**
- `endpoint` - Endpoint to destroy

---

### `evpl_endpoint_address`

```c
const char *evpl_endpoint_address(const struct evpl_endpoint *ep);
```

Get the IP/DNS address string from an endpoint.

**Parameters:**
- `ep` - Endpoint to query

**Returns:** Pointer to address string (valid until endpoint is closed)

---

### `evpl_endpoint_port`

```c
int evpl_endpoint_port(const struct evpl_endpoint *ep);
```

Get the port number from an endpoint.

**Parameters:**
- `ep` - Endpoint to query

**Returns:** Port number
